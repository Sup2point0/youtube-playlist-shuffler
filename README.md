Re-ordering YouTube playlists is one of the most painful tasks ever. Solving that is... very non-trivial, since no matter how compact your UI is you're gonna run out of space when the playlist has 5000 videos.

But for a lot of playlists, keeping it shuffled regularly is a nice workaround! Except YouTube doesn't have a 'shuffle' permanently button...
